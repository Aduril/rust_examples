* Rust Examples

just a bunch of example code to learn a bit about rust.
I am currently working with [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book][the book]].


** Lessons Learned

*** Chapter 1 

- Function have the structure of ~fn main() {...}~
- ~main()~ is a special function
- Standard tools
  - rustc (Compiler)
  - rustfmt (Formatter)
  - cargo (Build System)
- macros use a ~!~ at the end of the name (as in ~println!("Hello, wolrd!);
- use ~;~ at an expressions end

*** Chapter 2

*** Chapter 3

- without the ~;~ an expression becomes a statement
- A statement has a return value, e.g. ~fn six() { 6 }~ returns the value 6

*** Ownership

- Learned about Stack (Fast, but static sizes of element) and Heaps (Slower, but sizes are elastic)
- Every copy in rust is a shallow copy if not stated otherwise
- you can copy things of known size (like integers), which are stored on the stack
- you can only borrow things that go to the heap, otherwise you have to clone it

*** Chapter 8 - Collections
- [[./averager/src/main.rs][Averager]]
