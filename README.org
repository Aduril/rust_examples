* Rust Examples

just a bunch of example code to learn a bit about rust.
I am currently working with [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book][the book]].


** Lessons Learned

*** Chapter 1 

- Function have the structure of `fn main() {...}`
- `main()` is a special function
- Standard tools
  - rustc (Compiler)
  - rustfmt (Formatter)
  - cargo (Build System)
- macros use a `!` at the end of the name (as in `println!("Hello, wolrd!);
- use `;` at an expressions end
